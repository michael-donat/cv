Responsible for overhauling legacy in-house entertainment platform.
Both, customer and operator facing applications have been upgraded from PHP4 to PHP5 bringing in a new
flavour of MVC framework with component distribution and clean separation of concerns.
Central repository has been created to take data from operator facing systems and make it available
as a unified set for customer applications. This work resulted in a creation of distributed

Moni provides a cross-border money transfer application.</p>
          <p>Solution is mobile centric, in a client/server configuration where native apps
are using PHP/node.js backend service over a number of access APIs. Project
involved numerous integrations into 3rd party services operating in the financial
sector. Payment providers, cross border payout facilitators, FX services,
KYC/identity verification providers were all brought together in a very mature,
service oriented system that has been developed with the principles of hexagonal
architecture in mind.</p>
          <p>From the early days code has been nearly 100% covered, continuously integrated and deployed which warranted
frequent releases and sporadic bugs.</p>
          <p>Entire platform has been hosted within the AWS cloud, relying heavily on docker containers and automated provisioning with ansible and the aws-cli.</p>
