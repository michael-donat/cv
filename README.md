Small CV generator. Results at: https://michael-donat.github.io/cv

# Usage

If you think it's cool and would like to use it, here are the required steps...

 - fork the repo
 - clone it
 - run ```npm install``` to get the deps installed
 - edit copy in ```default``` folder
 - run ```make index```
 - verify results by opening the ```build/index.html``` file
 - run ```make deploy``` to automatically deploy your CV to github pages
 
As far as customising the look and feel goes, everything is pretty plain and contained in the cv.handlebars file, edit that before building to make any changes you may want.
