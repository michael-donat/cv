Moni provides a cross-border money transfer application.

Solution is mobile centric, in a client/server configuration where native apps
are using PHP/node.js backend service over a number of access APIs. Project
involved numerous integrations into 3rd party services operating in the financial
sector. Payment providers, cross border payout facilitators, FX services,
KYC/identity verification providers were all brought together in a very mature,
service oriented system that has been developed with the principles of hexagonal
architecture in mind.

From the early days code has been nearly 100% covered, continuously integrated and deployed which warranted
frequent releases and sporadic bugs.

Entire platform has been hosted within the AWS cloud, relying heavily on docker containers and automated provisioning with ansible and the aws-cli.
