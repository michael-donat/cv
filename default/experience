Joined UW as part of a new team to lead the business digital transformation. I was responsible for growing the
engineering department from a small team operating UW's old legacy platform to a modern, 100 strong product team built
on autonomy and end to end ownership of their product areas.

Initially focussed on bringing in new technology, replatforming, system design, and establishing the foundation of the
new UW platform long term. Transitioned from a mix of proprietary/LAMP stack to an eventually consistent, event sourced,
micro distributed architecture deployed in kubernetes with go-lang, typescript, react and react native as core building
blocks.

Introduced and established an engineering lead culture with focus on agile and devops mindsets, switch from management
to leadership, recruitment and onboarding strategies which lead to an environment engineers loved for being able to be
productive, experiment with new technologies, learn and grow their careers, be trusted and most importantly have fun
and satisfaction from their day to day.

Open source stack with staples including golang, typescript, react, react-native, graphql, grpc, kubernetes, docker,
cockroachdb, kafka, protocol buffers and many more cloud native technologies.
