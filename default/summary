I am a passionate technology manager with extensive experience in delivering complex web solutions.

Accomplished leader, developer and communicator, with a track record of building,
managing and motivating teams to release quality code frequently.
Strong believer in process and deployment automation, high code coverage, outside-in approach
and lean development methodologies.

Developer at heart, I like to stay close to the ground developing code, trying new technologies,
encouraging innovation and automating whenever possible.
