I have excellent track record in building development teams, with strong focus on autonomous engineering culture, agile methodologies and above all
trust in people given the right environment and guidance.

I have an extensive knowledge of system and solution design, event sourced micro distributed systems, domain driven design,
and platform integrations.

I specialise in refactoring large legacy platforms. I have designed, developed and maintained high
number of very large scale projects starting from purely web based, through mobile optimised to back-end APIs
and payment platforms.

I am committed to devops methodologies and all things automated.
I have provisioned platforms for automated software builds, continuous
integration and delivery, cloud environment provisioning and auto scaling.
