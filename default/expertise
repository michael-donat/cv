I have excellent experience in building engineering teams, introducing lean methodologies,
establishing development processes and discipline - from facilitating story writing workshops,
iteration planning, test discipline through to focus on engineering culture, peer motivation, performance management
and day to day development oversee.

I have an extensive knowledge of system architecture, object orientated programming, design patterns,
database designing and platform integration.
I specialise in refactoring large legacy platforms. I have designed, developed and maintained high
number of very large scale projects starting from purely web based, through mobile optimised to back-end APIs
and payment platforms.

I am committed to devops methodologies and all things automated.
I have provisioned platforms for automated software builds, continous
integration and delivery, cloud environment provisioning and auto scaling.
